<center><h1>Our Project</h1><br></center>
<a id="descript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of us are all high school students, and we understand the struggles of trying to find reliable resources to use while researching for a project or just for studying. The purpose of making this website is to provide high school students with a list of reliable resources to use, whether to study for a test or exam, to learn something by themselves, or to prepare for the SAT; we make it simple for students to find what they want without the endless results in the Google (or Bing) search page.</a>
